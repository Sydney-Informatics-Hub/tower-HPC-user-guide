## **Create your personal access token**

Workspace configuration can only be performed by admins but you will still need to create a personal access token and store it on your compute environment (i.e. on the HPC environment, not locally) in order to communicate with the Tower API. To create a personal access token you will need to navigate to the user settings logo in the top navbar and select 'Your tokens', then:

1. Select 'Add Token'.Â 
2. Name your token something descriptive and select 'Add':

3. Copy the token to your clipboard:
![](../images/interface_token.png){width=80%}

4. Open your terminal application, log in to your HPC (either NCI Gadi or Pawsey Setonix) on the command-line:
```bash
ssh abc123@gadi.nci.org.au
```

5. If you are using Gadi, navigate to `~` ($HOME):
```bash
cd ~
```

6. If you are on Setonix, navigate to `$MYSOFTWARE`:
```bash
cd $MYSOFTWARE
```

7. From within the directory mentioned above, make a hidden tower (`.tower`) directory to store Tower token and credentials:
```bash
mkdir .tower
```

8. Copy your personal access token into a file named token within this directory:
