## **National Computational Infrastructure**

NCI is a research-focused organisation that provides advanced computing, data storage, and data management solutions to support scientific research and innovation in Australia and beyond.
NCI's HPC systems are designed to handle complex computational tasks, such as simulations, data analysis, and modeling, for a wide range of scientific disciplines, including climate modeling, genomics, astronomy, and materials science. The University of Sydney provides its researchers with subsidised access to NCI's infrastructure. 

## **Resources**

-   [NCI help](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Getting+Started+at+NCI)

## **Set up your NCI Account**

All new users must create their account through the [NCI online self service portal](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/). To create your account you will need the following information:

- Your Name
- Institutional email address (Gmail, Hotmail, etc. are not accepted)
- Mobile phone number
- Either:
  - NCI project code of an existing project you wish to join
  - A new project proposal to be assessed by a Scheme Manager to determine if they will grant your project time

Note that resources at NCI are allocated to **projects** and not to individual users.

Complete all steps below to set up an NCI account:

1. Click on 'Sign up' link on the [NCI online self service portal](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/):

2. Accept the terms and conditions:

3. Provide your personal details: 
![](../images/Screen%20Shot%202023-09-06%20at%2012.02.45%20pm.png)

4. Provide details on the project you'll be working on:

5. Select University of Sydney as you institution: 
![](../images/Screen%20Shot%202023-09-06%20at%2012.04.24%20pm.png)

Your username will become active when a project Lead CI approves your request to join their project, or when a Scheme Manager approves your new project proposal. You will receive a confirmation email from the Mancini system when your username is activated.

## **Using a terminal application**

Once you have been granted access to NCI you are able to access the platform. To do this, you will need to download a terminal application on your local computer or via NCI's [Australian Research Environment platform (ARE)](https://are-auth.nci.org.au/auth/ldap/login?back=&state=wemd7xq6h4fwgxmpdodee2g2w). 

If you don't have a terminal already or know what one is, it is used to provide a window with a command line interface through which you can send commands to be executed by the HPC remotely or your local machine. See [here](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/training.artemis.introhpc/setup.html#1-get-a-shell-terminal-emulator) for instructions on downloading a terminal application for your computer.

### **Log into Gadi**

You will need to access the Gadi HPC via the command line when using the Nextflow Tower service for a few purposes: 

1. To transfer data to and from the University of Sydney's research data store 
2. To turn on the Tower Agent before running a workflow

Access to Gadi is via SSH to **gadi.nci.org.au**. This provides a Unix shell on one of the Gadi login nodes.

Open a terminal application and type the following command:

```bash
ssh abc123@gadi.nci.org.au 
```

Replace abc123 with your own username. Enter your password when prompted. If you can't remember your password, you can reset it via [Mancini](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/reset/password/). Navigate to your project space: 

```bash
cd /scratch/ab01
```

Replace ab01 with your project name. 

### **Copy your data to Gadi**

To copy files to Gadi you should use the Gadi data mover queue and **gadi-dm.nci.org.au**. To transfer data from USyd's RDS via a PBS job, you'll need to set up ssh keys for passwordless transfer of datasets using the University of Sydney's Artemis HPC. 

#### **Set up ssh keys**

**1. Generate SSH Key Pair on the Artemis HPC**

Log in to the Artemis HPC and stay in your home directory:

```bash
ssh unikey@hpc.sydney.edu.au
```

Run the following command to generate an SSH key pair without a passphrase:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N ""
```

Press enter when prompted, saving the key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. 

**2. Set Appropriate Permissions**

Ensure that your SSH key files have the appropriate permissions to maintain a secure environment:

Set permissions on your SSH key files using `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Create the authorized_keys file to transfer to Gadi HPC:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/authorized_keys
```

Then set permissions on this file with `chmod`:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/authorized_keys
```

**3. Transfer Public Key to Gadi**

Now move your `authorized_keys` file to Gadi HPC. Start by logging into Gadi from the Artemis HPC CLI and provide your password when prompted: 

```bash
sftp abc123@gadi-dm.nci.org.au
```

Replace abc123 above with your NCI username. 

If you don't already have an .ssh directory in your home directory, you'll need to create one: 

```bash 
mkdir ~/.ssh 
```

Move into the .ssh directory and transfer your `authorized_keys` file: 

```bash 
cd ~/.ssh
```

```bash
put authorized_keys
```

This will transfer authorized_keys on Gadi to your current directory. With sftp, it will look for the file relative to where you launched sftp. You can check where you are on Artemis using `lls`. 

**4. Set Up the Public Key on the Gadi HPC**

Log in to the Gadi HPC via the data mover address: 

```bash
ssh abc123@gadi-dm.nci.org.au
```

Append the transferred public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file using the following command:

   ```sh
   cat /path/to/directory/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

7. Set appropriate permissions for the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:

   ```sh
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

**5. Test the setup**

Logout using `ctrl`+`z` and test the sftp connection. You should not need to use a password:

```bash
sftp abc123@gadi-dm.nci.org.au
```

This completes the setup. Now you can log in to the Gadi HPC from the Artemis HPC without entering a password each time. Be sure to handle your private key securely, especially since it is not passphrase protected.

#### **Copying files from RDS to Gadi**

Using a PBS job to transfer data transfer between Artemis HPC and NCI's Gadi HPC using `scp` or `rsync` is a good practice. Below is a simple example of a PBS script that you might run from Artemis to transfer data to Gadi HPC:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Transfer files from Gadi to RDS by submitting this job on Artemis
# Must have ssh-keys set up for passwordless transfer

#PBS -P SIH
#PBS -N transfer
#PBS -l walltime=24:00:00
#PBS -l ncpus=1
#PBS -l mem=40GB
#PBS -W umask=022
#PBS -q dtq

nci_username= #specify your nci username
source_host=${nci_username}@gadi-dm.nci.org.au
source_path= #specify path to data to be transferred
destination_path=/rds/PRJ-SIH/FromGadi #specify path of where you'd like to upload data

while [ 1 ]
do
  echo Transferring ${source_host}:${source_path}/${dir} to ${destination_path}
  rsync -rPvz -L --append-verify ${source_host}:${source_path}/${dir} ${destination_path}

done

```
