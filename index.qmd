Nextflow Tower is a full-stack solution for the management of Nextflow pipeline executions.
It's designed as an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows you to control and monitor your data analysis pipelines.
It simplifies running complex workflows, like those provided by nf-core, on different computation infrastructures such as HPC clusters, cloud services, or Kubernetes.

The Tower service is offered in two ways; a free basic account that can be used by individuals and a licensed service that is suitable for large organisations with multiple collaborators that require more complex user management.
The [Australian BioCommons Nextflow Tower service](https://www.biocommons.org.au/nextflow-tower) is licensed and provides a centralised command-post for running Nextflow pipelines as a subsidised service for Australian researchers.

## Getting started with the Australian BioCommons service

Nextflow Tower provides a centralised interface for managing users, workspaces, compute environments, and workflows within defined spaces called workspaces.
These workspaces are provided by the Australian BioCommons and workspace management and curation is relegated to  the workspace administrators.
Regarding [workspace managemen](https://help.tower.nf/23.1/orgs-and-teams/workspace-management/)t, this means that:

-   Only organisation owners are permitted to create a workspace within the organisation.

-   Workspaces are currently provided to use cases for the pilot program of the Australian BioCommons Nextflow Tower service. 

-   The Australian BioCommons service team has insight into and administrative control over workspaces.

As you use Tower, keep in mind there are a number of [key terms and core concepts](https://help.tower.nf/23.1/getting-started/definitions/) that you will come across as you set up your workspace, configure your compute environments, and execute your workflows.
