## National Computational Infrastructure

NCI is a research-focused organization that provides advanced computing, data storage, and data management solutions to support scientific research and innovation in Australia and beyond.
NCI's HPC systems are designed to handle complex computational tasks, such as simulations, data analysis, and modeling, for a wide range of scientific disciplines, including climate modeling, genomics, astronomy, and materials science.

## Resources

## Setting up your NCI Account

All new users must create their account through the [NCI online self service portal](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/).

To create your account you will need the following information:

-   Your Name

-   Mobile phone number (optional, but strongly encouraged as you otherwise won't be able to easily reset your password)

-   Either:

    -   NCI project code of an existing project you wish to join

    -   A new project proposal to be assessed by a Scheme Manager to determine if they will grant your project time

Note that resources at NCI are allocated to *projects* and not to individual users.
