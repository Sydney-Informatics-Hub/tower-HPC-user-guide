## Getting Started at NCI

### Setting up your NCI Account

All new users must create their account through the [NCI online self service portal](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/).

To create your account you will need the following information:

-   Your Name

-   Institutional email address (Gmail, Hotmail, etc are not accepted)

-   Mobile phone number (optional, but strongly encouraged as you otherwise won't be able to easily reset your password)

-   Either:

    -   NCI project code of an existing project you wish to join

    -   A new project proposal to be assessed by a Scheme Manager to determine if they will grant your project time

Note that resources at NCI are allocated to *projects* and not to individual users.
