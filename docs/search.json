    "text": "Nextflow Tower is a full-stack solution for the management of Nextflow pipeline executions. It’s designed as an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows you to control and monitor your data analysis pipelines. It simplifies running complex workflows, like those provided by nf-core, on different computation infrastructures such as HPC clusters, cloud services, or Kubernetes.\nThe Tower service is offered in two ways; a free basic account that can be used by individuals and a licensed service that is suitable for large organisations with multiple collaborators that require more complex user management. The Australian BioCommons Nextflow Tower service is licensed and provides a centralised command-post for running Nextflow pipelines as a subsidised service for Australian researchers.\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

For example:\n\nNo previous programming experience is required, but Session 1 is a pre-requisite for the other sessions. Training will be delivered online, so you will need access to a modern computer with a stable internet connection and around 5GB of storage space for data downloaded prior to the course. Participants are encouraged to setup a Python environment on their local computer (as per the Setup Instructions provided), but participation using other platforms/environments can be supported where necessary."

This could also be moved to an about page.\nHere’s an example for a zoom only online course:\n\nSessions will be recorded for attendees only, and it is set up to only record the host shared screen and host audio. We will try and get these uploaded to this site as soon as possible. Please interrupt whenever you want! Ideally, have your camera on and interact as much as possible. There will be someone monitoring the chat-window with any questions you would like to post there. Four hours is a long Zoom session so we have plenty of scheduled breaks combined with a mix of content to be delivered as demos, plus sections as independent exercises, but most of the course will be pretty-hands on with everyone writing their own code. We will use Zoom break-out rooms as needed with the Trainers and participants."

They can take values as input and give values back (or not).\n\n#Declare the name of the function\ndef add_numbers(x,y):\n    '''adds two numbers\n    usage: myaddition=addnumbers(x,y)\n    returns: z\n    inputs: x,y\n    x and y are two integers\n    z is the summation of x and y\n    '''\n    \n    z=x+y\n    \n    return(z)\n\nNote the indentation - Python forces your code to be nicely readable by using ‘whitespace’/indentation to signify what chunks of code are related. You will see this more later, but generally you should try and write readable code and follow style standards\nMany functions have a header - formatted as a multiline comment with three ’’’. This hopefully will tell you about the function\nAnyway, let’s run our function, now that we have initialised it!\n\nadd_numbers(1,2)\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\nWrite a function to convert map scale. For example, on a 1:25,000 map (good for hiking!) the distance between two points is 15 cm. How far apart are these in real life? (3750 m).\n[Reminder: 15 cm * 25000 = 375000 cm = 3750 m]\nYour function should take as input two numbers: the distance on the map (in cm) and the second number of the scale and, i.e. calculate_distance(15, 25000) should return 375000\n\n\nSolution\n\n#Declare the name of the function\ndef calculate_distance(distance_cm,scale):\n    '''calculates distance based on map and scale\n    returns: z\n    inputs: distance_cm,scale\n    distance_cm and scale are two integers\n    returns the product of distance_cm and scale\n    '''  \n    \n    return(distance_cm * scale)\n\n\n\n#First we have to load some modules to do the work for us.\n#Modules are packages people have written so we do not have to re-invent everything!\n\n#The first is NUMerical PYthon. A very popular matrix, math, array and data manipulation library.\nimport numpy as np\n\n#This is a library for making figures (originally based off Matlab plotting routines)\n#We use the alias 'plt' because we don't want to type out the whole name every time we reference it!\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\n# random code from matplotlib docs\n# Fixing random state for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(19680801)\n\n\nplt.rcdefaults()\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Example data\npeople = ('Tom', 'Dick', 'Harry', 'Slim', 'Jim')\ny_pos = np.arange(len(people))\nperformance = 3 + 10 * np.random.rand(len(people))\nerror = np.random.rand(len(people))\n\nax.barh(y_pos, performance, xerr=error, align='center')\nax.set_yticks(y_pos, labels=people)\nax.invert_yaxis()  # labels read top-to-bottom\nax.set_xlabel('Performance')\nax.set_title('How fast do you want to go today?')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\nYou can store things in Python in variables\nLists can be used to store objects of different types\nLoops with for can be used to iterate over each object in a list\nFunctions are used to write (and debug) repetitive code once\nIndexing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

Run them from here by selecting the 'Launch' button for the pipeline of interest. \nRuns: from here you can monitor and inspect the details of all previous workflow executions that you and other users in your workspace have run.\nActions: you can use Github and Tower webhooks to trigger an automated pipeline test run based on things like pipeline version release. \nDatasets: you can store pipeline input sample sheets here that specify metadata and file paths for each of your datapoints or samples to be processed by a workflow. \nCompute environment: Tower can be used to deploy workflows on various environments, here you will be able to manage and find your preconfigured environments. \nCredentials: here you can store all your authentication keys, credentials required to access private code repositories on GitHub, the Tower agent on HPCs, and external services. These are all encrypted, so they cannot be accessed by anyone else once you've stored them. \nSecrets: Ignore for now. \nParticipants: here you can see and manage (if you are an admin) the other users in your workspace and define user roles to control access. \nSettings: manage some basic workspace settings (if you are an admin)."
